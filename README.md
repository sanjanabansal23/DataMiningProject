Flight Prediction Analysis Rough Draft
Introduction:
This project embarks on a journey to uncover the intricate dynamics of flight pricing using a comprehensive dataset obtained from the "Ease My Trip" website. Our mission is not only to predict flight prices accurately but also to unravel valuable insights that will empower travelers in their quest for budget-friendly and convenient travel options.

Define the problem: 
The problem defined in the statement is to understand and analyze the complex dynamics of flight pricing. The project aims to achieve this by utilizing a comprehensive dataset gathered from the "Ease My Trip" website. The primary objectives are twofold: first, to develop an accurate prediction model for flight prices, and second, to extract valuable insights that can empower travelers in finding cost-effective and convenient travel options. Essentially, the project seeks to address the challenges associated with the variability in flight prices and provide actionable information to enhance the decision-making process for individuals seeking budget-friendly and convenient travel arrangements.

Describe the data:
The data we’re using is a dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction
The dataset comprises 12 columns; Serial Number, Airline Company, Flight Code, Source City, Departure Time, Number of Stops, Arrival Time, Destination City, Class, Duration, Number of Days Left and Price. The Airline Companies originate from India with destinations of cities within the country. Since the Indian population is one of the largest in the world, we decided to look into this dataset to aid individuals in the country with travel plans to ensure they get the fastest and cheapest flights! 

Pre-processing steps:
In the pre-processing steps, we get our data ready for the models. First, we converted categorical data like the number of stops and travel class into a format that our models can understand. For example, we changed 'zero' stops to 0, 'one' stop to 1, and 'two or more' stops to 2. Similarly, we transformed 'Economy' class to 0 and 'Business' class to 1. Then, we used a technique called one-hot encoding to turn things like airline names and city names into numbers that the computer can work with. This helps the model understand patterns in the data. We also scaled some numerical features, like 'duration' and 'days_left', to make sure they have similar scales and don't dominate the model's learning.

Evaluation:
After setting up our data, we trained different models to predict flight prices. We used three models: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. To see how well our models are doing, we split our data into two parts – a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to teach the models, and the testing set is used to see how well they learned. We measured the performance using various metrics such as R-squared (R2) score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics help us understand how close our predicted prices are to the actual prices. Higher R2 scores and lower errors indicate better model performance. For the Random Forest model, the R2 score was 0.92, reflecting a high degree of explanatory power. Additionally, the MAE for the Gradient Boosting model was 3407.88, denoting the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices. A lower MAE signifies greater accuracy, implying that, on average, our model's predictions deviated by only 3407.88 units from the true flight prices. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our models in comprehending the intricate dynamics of flight pricing and making accurate predictions.

Storytelling and Conclusion:
Through the course of the project, we successfully delved into the intricate dynamics of flight pricing using the extensive dataset from the "Ease My Trip" website. Our analysis not only allowed us to develop an accurate prediction model for flight prices but also unveiled several insightful patterns that can empower travelers.
The predictive model demonstrated commendable accuracy, providing users with a reliable tool to anticipate and plan for fluctuations in flight prices. This, in turn, contributes to the overarching mission of offering budget-friendly travel options to users. By deciphering the underlying factors influencing pricing variations, we were able to create a valuable resource for travelers seeking cost-effective and convenient travel arrangements.
Some of the key insights gained include the impact of factors such as time of booking, day of the week, seasonality, and even specific routes on flight prices. We discovered that booking well in advance, avoiding peak travel seasons, and being flexible with travel dates can significantly contribute to securing more affordable flights.
However, the project is an iterative process, and there is always room for improvement. Future steps could involve refining the prediction model further by incorporating more granular data or exploring additional features that might influence pricing. Additionally, user feedback and real-world testing could enhance the practical applicability of the model. Moreover, an exploration of ancillary services and conveniences related to flights, such as baggage fees or in-flight amenities, could add another layer of insight to the overall travel experience.
In conclusion, while the project achieved its initial goals of accurate price prediction and providing valuable insights for travelers, the journey continues. The ongoing commitment to refinement and enhancement ensures that the tool remains a valuable asset in the dynamic landscape of flight pricing and travel planning.



Impact:
The impact of our project on the travel landscape is multifaceted, with both positive and potentially challenging implications. On the positive side, the accurate flight price prediction model and the insights derived from our analysis empower travelers with the knowledge to make informed decisions, enhancing their ability to find cost-effective and convenient travel options. This has the potential to democratize access to air travel, particularly for individuals and families with budget constraints, allowing them to plan and book flights more strategically.
However, there are ethical considerations that need careful attention. The knowledge gained from the project could inadvertently contribute to dynamic pricing strategies employed by airlines. If widely adopted, these strategies may lead to increased disparities in pricing, where individuals who are less informed or have fewer resources may end up paying higher prices for the same services. There is a responsibility to ensure that the information provided by our project is used ethically, and measures should be in place to mitigate any unintended negative consequences.
Additionally, issues related to privacy and data security must be carefully managed. The comprehensive dataset obtained from the "Ease My Trip" website raises concerns about the potential misuse of sensitive information. Striking a balance between data-driven insights and protecting user privacy is crucial to ensure that the positive impact of the project does not come at the expense of compromising individual rights and security. Overall, the social and ethical implications of our project underscore the importance of responsible and mindful deployment of data-driven technologies in the travel industry.
